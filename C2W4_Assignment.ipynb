These numpy arrays should have type `float64`.\n\n A couple of things to keep in mind:\n \n- The first line contains the column headers, so you should ignore it.\n\n- Each successive line contains 785 comma-separated values between 0 and 255\n  - The first value is the label\n\n  - The rest are the pixel values for that picture\n\n  \n**Hint**:\n\nYou have two options to solve this function. \n  \n   - 1. One is to use `csv.reader` and create a for loop that reads from it, if you take this approach take this into consideration:\n\n        - `csv.reader` returns an iterable that returns a row of the csv file in each iteration.\n    Following this convention, row[0] has the label and row[1:] has the 784 pixel values.\n\n        - To reshape the arrays (going from 784 to 28x28), you can use functions such as [`np.array_split`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array_split.html) or [`np.reshape`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html).\n\n        - For type conversion of the numpy arrays, use the method [`np.ndarray.astype`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html).\n\n\n   - 2. The other one is to use `np.loadtxt`. You can find the documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html).\n   \n   \nRegardless of the method you chose, your function should finish its execution in under 1 minute. If you see that your function is taking a long time to run, try changing your implementation.",

For this complete the `train_val_generators` function below.\n\nSome important notes:\n\n- The images in this dataset come in the same resolution so you don't need to set a custom `target_size` in this case. In fact, you can't even do so because this time you will not be using the `flow_from_directory` method (as in previous assignments). Instead you will use the [`flow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator#flow) method.\n- You need to add the \"color\" dimension to the numpy arrays that encode the images. These are black and white images, so this new dimension should have a size of 1 (instead of 3, which is used when dealing with colored images). Take a look at the function [`np.expand_dims`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html) for this.",
